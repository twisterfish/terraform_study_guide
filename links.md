The following are links to some study aids for those wanting to dive deeper or study for the certification.

#### Hashicorp

Hashicorp is the company that makes Terraform and administers the certification exam. Their certification prep is the first resource you should consult.

The official study guide is at the link below.

It is strongly recommended that you do all the tutorials in the study guide. A good measure of how well you are doing is if you understand exactly what is happening in each step
